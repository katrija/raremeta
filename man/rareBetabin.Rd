(either \code{"logOR"} for the log odds ratio or \code{"logRR"} for the log relative risk).}

to differ between the two groups (\code{FALSE}). See below for more detail.s}

should be rounded (if unspecified, the default is 4).}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether output should be generated on the progress of model
fitting (the default is \code{FALSE}). Can also be an integer. Values > 1 generate more verbose output.}

\description{
Function to conduct a meta-analysis of a rare event using a beta-binomial model
See below for more details on this model and its application in meta-analyses of
rare events.

\details{

\subsection{Data input}{

Data input can happen either through the parameter \code{x} (an object of type \code{rareData})
or through the parameters \code{ai},\code{bi},\code{ci}, \code{di}, \code{n1i}, \code{n2i}, \code{data} (columns of a dataframe).
A \code{rareData} object can be produced from a data frame by applying the \code{rareDescribe()} function to it.
The \code{rareDescribe()} function pre-processes the data frame and stores the information required by the \code{rareES()} function
in a list. See \code{?rareDescribe} for more details.
}

\subsection{Effect size measures}{

The function includes different versions of the beta-binomial model (see Kuss (2014), for a description).
The regression equation used in all these models can be expressed as

\mjseqn{g(\mu_j) = \alpha + \theta \cdot x_{ij}},

where \mjseqn{i = 1, ..., k } is the study index and \mjseqn{j = 1, 2} is the group index,
\mjseqn{x_{i1} = 1} and \mjseqn{x_{i2} = 0}.

All models assume that the number of events in each group follows a beta-binomial distribution
with mean \mjseqn{n_{ij}\mu_j} and intraclass correlation \mjseqn{\rho_j}.

For \code{measure = "logOR"}, \mjseqn{g(\cdot)} corresponds to the logit function, i.e., \mjseqn{g(\mu_j) = \log \left( \frac{\mu_j}{1-\mu_j} \right)}.

For \code{measure = "logRR"}, \mjseqn{g(\cdot)} correspond to the natural logarithm.

It is currently not possible to use \code{rareBetabin} with \code{measure = "RD"},
but this functionality may be implemented in future versions of this package.
}

\subsection{Group-specific intraclass correlation}{

Per default, it is assumed that \mjseqn{\rho_1 = \rho_2}, i.e. the intraclass correlations
are assumed to be equal for both groups. It is possible to fit the beta-binomial
with different intraclass correlations by setting \code{common_rho} to \code{FALSE}.
Internally, different intraclass correlations are modeled via the regression equation

\mjseqn{\log\left(\frac{\rho_j}{1-\rho_j}\right) = \zeta + \gamma \cdot x_{ij}},

where \mjseqn{x_{i1} = 1} and \mjseqn{x_{i2} = 0}. Estimates
for \mjseqn{\rho_1} and \mjseqn{\rho_2} are then obtained by back-transforming
the results to the original scale.
